# Tendermint-Base

* Basic Tendermint BFT consensus algorithm, as described in the [white paper](https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10214/9769/Buchman_Ethan_201606_MAsc.pdf?sequence=7&isAllowed=y)
* We assume all nodes behave according to protocol.
* Round-robin order pre-determined.
* Initial implementation will not include syncing mechanisms (Chapter 4.2.2)
